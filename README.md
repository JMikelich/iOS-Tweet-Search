# iOS-Tweet-Search

Overview: This is the basic platform I designed in order to search tweets using iOS Twitter API's. The app has two main functionalities: search and save tweets, view and delete saved tweets.


Description: Using Accounts.h and Social.h, the app perfoms a search of all user tweets for a specify keyword/s. These results are displayed on a table view and the user has the ability to select tweets they like to view later. These saved tweets are stored in Core Data.

Usage: The app is compatable with all Apple iOS devices.
